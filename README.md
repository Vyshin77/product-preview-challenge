## Overview

This challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile view
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project helped me with learning css flexbox and also how to use the CSS pseudo selectors for an actual project

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
``` css
  button:hover {
  background-color: hsl(158, 76%, 13%);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

I will like to use other CSS pseudo selectors in other projects that I'll undertake.
